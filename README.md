# Preparing For Interviews

These is a collection of resources, code, and questions that I have gotten over time. Hopefully it
is helpful in the future when it comes to preparing for interviews again.

## LeetCode

These are some of the questions I've practiced.

## Data Structures

I grouped these categories together based on the chapters in "Cracking the Coding Interview". If it
makes sense to change them in the future, I will.

- Arrays and Strings
- Linked Lists
- Stacks and Queues
- Trees and Graphs

## Algorithms

I grouped these categories together based on the chapters in "Cracking the Coding Interview".
If it makes sense to change them in the future, I will.

- Bit Manipulation
- Math and Logic Puzzles
- Object-Oriented Design
- Recursion and Dynamic Programming
- System Design and Scalability
- Sorting and Searching
- Testing

## Embedded

These will be common embedded questions such as C language questions, ISR related questions,
endian questions, etc.

## Operating Systems

These will be operating system related questions such as caching, scheduling, etc. There is some
overlap between operating systems and embedded, but that's ok.

## Company Specific Questions

Here are some of the questions I've been asked during my interviews.
